# T Wizard Calculator

This is my second react app, so it's pretty simple. The project was initiated with 'create-react-app'. 

I did try to add little of my own flavor by adding a component which displays the 10 most recent operations and by enabling keyboard input.

The ui loosly follows Google's Material design principles, which were helpful in creating a clean, friendly asthetic.


# Running the calculator

The final build can be found in the build folder. 

You will need to run the app on a locally hosted server. The quickest way imo is to install 'serve' from npm with: 'npm install -g serve', then run the command 'serve -s' in the build folder (or 'serve -s build' from the main project folder).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
