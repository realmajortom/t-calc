#Elefant Calculator

Pretty generic calculator built with react. I added a little of my own flavor by including a component which displays the 10 most recent operations. You'll also noticed the calculator can be used with only your keyboard!

# Running the calculator

The final build can be found in the build folder. 

You will need to run the app on a locally hosted server. The quickest way imo is to install 'serve' from npm with: 'npm install -g serve', then run the command 'serve -s' in the build folder (or 'serve -s build' from the main project folder).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
